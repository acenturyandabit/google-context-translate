# Google Chrome Inline Translate
Google's translate function is brilliant, no doubt, but it leaves language learners stuck between full-page translations or knee-deep in the raw text. 

Enter Google Chrome Inline Translate. Simply highlight the word/sentence you want, and this nifty little extension will translate *JUST THAT WORD/SENTENCE* inline!

## How can I use it?
1. Install the extension, downloadable [on my github](http://github.com/acenturyandabit/google-context-translate). I'm not putting it on the Chrome Web Store because Google probably won't like me :(
2. Open up a google translate in another tab. This extension can't translate without daddy google, but it makes do.
    - If you're only planning to translate one language, you can select it, otherwise we recommend that you keep google translate on its default 'Detect Language' setting.
3. Go to some foreign language page.
4. Highlight the word(s) you want to translate.
5. Right click and select 'Google Translate this section'.
6. Wait a few seconds. (For people with slower internet connections, wait a bit longer :3)
7. The word will now display its translation any time you hover over it.

## I want to contribute!

The project is hosted open source on [a github repository](http://github.com/acenturyandabit/google-context-translate).

A few things that need doing:
- Get the tooltip to alert the user if no google translate tab is open

If something's annoying you, submit an issue! If you can code, fix some issues! That's the way open source works :3
